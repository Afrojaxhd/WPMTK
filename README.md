# Windows Process Manipulation Toolkit
C# and C++ game hacking dynamic link library (.dll) for Windows. Features powerful address manipulation "WPMTK.dll", custom GDI overlay library "WOTK.dll", and best of all (are you ready for it?); entirely undetectable, extremely easy to use, without any loss in power.

## WPMTK.dll <sup>Windows Process Manipulation Toolkit</sup>
The WPMTK library makes manipulating the target process a breeze. By creating bindings to the Windows API through dll files, it becomes a powerful vector in hacking games. The lib directly accesses the windows dlls to reach right around and snatch processes by their tails.

_This library requires the dependency "VAMemory.dll"; included when released. VAMemory simplifies the reading and writing of memory addresses within the target process._

## WOTK.dll <sup>Windows Overlay Toolkit</sup>
The WOTK library enables you to create complex overlays for your Windows desktop games and applications. You will still need to work with memory addresses a lot to get the overlay drawing health, but it's much as able as building from the ground up; with the right programmer to make use of it.

### The WOTK library contains:
* Complex drawing algorithms like beziers, polygons, and text.
* Complete undetectability, because of the way we developed it.
