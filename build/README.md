# Windows Process Manipulation Toolkit
C# game hacking static library for Windows. Features powerful address manipulation "WPMTK.dll", custom GDI overlay library "WOTK.dll", and best of all (are you ready for it?); entirely undetectable, extremely easy to use, without any loss in ability.

## WPMTK.dll <sup>Windows Process Manipulation Toolkit</sup>
The WPMTK library makes manipulating the target process a breeze. By creating bindings to the Windows API through dll files, it becomes a powerful vector in hacking games. The lib directly accesses the windows dlls to reach right around and snatch processes by their tails.

_This library requires the dependency "VAMemory.dll"; included when released. VAMemory simplifies the reading and writing of memory addresses within the target process._

## WOTK.dll <sup>Windows Overlay Toolkit</sup>
The WOTK library enables you to create complex overlays for your Windows desktop games and applications. You will still need to work with memory addresses a lot to get the overlay drawing health, but it's much as able as building from the ground up; with the right programmer to make use of it.

### The WOTK library comes with:
* Complex drawing algorithms like beziers, polygons, and text.
* Complete undetectability, because of the way we developed it.

# Tutorial
If you're looking for a place to get started, I've written a .pdf packaged with the DLL files with a little bit of information about them, and how to create a new project and set it up.

_You can find this .pdf file in the folder with the DLLs, called "readme.pdf"._

# For Help With Documentation
* Hover over our method names and there should be some useful information about what it does and what it requires.
* To browse our documentation, we release the DLL files with each their own (besides VAMemory.dll) an .xml file. The .xml file contains all of the documentation of the library and it's functions.
